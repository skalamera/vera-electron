# Vera Desktop - Test Guide

## What We've Built

A fully functional Electron application that transforms websites into desktop apps with spaces and multi-account support, implementing the core features from the WebCatalog/Vera Desktop documentation.

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Spaces Management**
   - Create multiple isolated environments
   - Each space has its own color, name, and settings
   - Isolated browser sessions per space
   - Ad blocking per space

2. **App Management**
   - Add apps from pre-configured catalog
   - Create custom apps from any URL
   - Each app runs in its own webview with isolated session
   - Apps maintain separate cookies/storage within their space

3. **User Interface**
   - Modern, clean design with sidebar navigation
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Modals for creating spaces and adding apps
   - System tray integration (macOS)
   - Custom titlebar for Windows/Linux

4. **Security**
   - Context isolation enabled
   - Sandboxed renderer processes
   - Secure IPC communication
   - No direct Node.js access in renderers

5. **Data Persistence**
   - All settings stored locally using electron-store
   - Spaces and apps persist between sessions

## How to Test

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd vera-desktop
   npm start
   ```

2. **Create your first space:**
   - Click "Create Your First Space" or the "+" button in sidebar
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Work" or "Personal")
   - Choose a color
   - Click "Create Space"

3. **Add apps to the space:**
   - Click the "+" button in the space view
   - Browse the app catalog (Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.)
   - Or switch to "Custom App" tab to add any website
   - Click on an app to add it

4. **Use the apps:**
   - Click any app icon to open it in a webview
   - Each app maintains its own session within the space
   - You can log into different accounts in different spaces

5. **Test multiple spaces:**
   - Create another space (e.g., "Personal")
   - Add the same apps (e.g., Gmail)
   - Notice you can be logged into different accounts

6. **Test settings:**
   - Click the Settings button in sidebar
   - Toggle dark theme
   - Enable/disable ad blocking

## Features Not Implemented (Future Roadmap)

1. **Subspaces** - Nested browser environments within spaces
2. **Cloud Sync** - Syncing across devices (Pro feature)
3. **App Lock** - Password/biometric protection
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Quick app switching
5. **Menu Bar Apps** - Pin apps to system menu bar
6. **Default App Handler** - Set as default email/calendar
7. **Extensions Support** - Browser extensions
8. **Import/Export** - Backup and restore settings

## Known Limitations

1. Tray icon only works on macOS (needs proper icons for Windows/Linux)
2. App icons are using emojis (real app would fetch proper icons)
3. App catalog is hardcoded (real app would fetch from API)
4. No auto-updates implemented
5. No analytics or crash reporting
